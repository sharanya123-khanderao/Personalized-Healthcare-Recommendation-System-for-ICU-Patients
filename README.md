# Personalized-Healthcare-Recommendation-System-for-ICU-Patients

Introduction 
Intensive Care Units (ICUs) are critical healthcare environments where patients with severe
or life-threatening conditions receive specialized care. ICU patients often have complex
medical histories and require highly personalized treatment plans. However, the vast amount
of data generated in ICUs—ranging from structured data like lab results and vitals to
unstructured data like clinical notes—poses a significant challenge for healthcare providers.
Analyzing this data manually is time-consuming and error-prone, often leading to delayed or
suboptimal treatment decisions.
To address this challenge, we propose a Personalized Healthcare Recommendation System
for ICU Patients. This system leverages the MIMIC-III dataset, a comprehensive
collection of de-identified ICU patient records, to provide data-driven treatment
recommendations. By combining machine learning, natural language processing (NLP),
and time-series analysis, the system aims to:
1. Predict patient deterioration early by analyzing vital signs, lab results, and medical
history.
2. Classify patients into risk levels (low, medium, high) to prioritize critical cases and
optimize resource allocation.
3. Extract insights from clinical notes using advanced NLP techniques to uncover
hidden patterns and improve decision-making.
4. Analyze longitudinal trends in patient data to detect potential complications before
they become critical.
The ultimate goal of this project is to assist healthcare providers in making informed, timely,
and personalized treatment decisions, ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing
the burden on ICU resources.
